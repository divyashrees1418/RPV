	Residential property valuation (RPV) is a website that predicts the value of a residence.
     It allows users to provide their specifications so that a price for their residence can 
     be determined without the use of an intermediary. The website accepts two types of inputs
      one is Blueprint of the house and the other one which accepts the specifications of the
       users such as total area of the house, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking area etc. At the first 
       type Blueprints from the users are accepted which are then processed to find the total area,
        bedrooms, bathrooms, parking area etc. 
        which is then used to predict the price of the residence.
         In the second type required specifications are accepted manually from the user to predict the price of the 
         residence. We conclude that this website will help the users to get the price of their residence without any intermediary costâ€™s and will provide good accurate results.
